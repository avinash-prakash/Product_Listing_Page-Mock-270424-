Hii
This is my Product Listing Page clone for following Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a web application for listing and browsing products from an external API. The application should allow users to view products, filter them by category, search for specific products, and sort them by price.

Requirements:
Product Listing Page:

Implement a product listing page where users can view a grid of product items.
Each product item should display the product's image, title, and price.
Filtering by Category:

Provide a dropdown menu or select input for users to filter products by category.
Users should be able to select a specific category to filter products accordingly.
Include an option to display products from all categories.
Search Functionality:

Implement a search input field where users can search for products by their title.
As users type in the search input, the product list should dynamically update to display matching products.
The search should be case-insensitive and should match partial strings.
Sorting by Price:

Provide an option for users to sort products by price in ascending or descending order.
Implement a dropdown menu or select input for users to select the sorting order.
User Interface Design:

Design the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly.
Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and styling for a visually appealing experience.
